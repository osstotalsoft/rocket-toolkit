# apollo-logger
This is a GraphQL Apollo logging plugin, that will help you trace all your requests inside your GraphQL server. It also allows you to persist the logs as desired.
For security reasons, errors thrown inside Apollo Server, are wrapped in a 'user friendly message'. This helps you not to leak sensitive data from unauthorized users.
